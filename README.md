# C--Notes-App
My first app using C++! A basic notes app that runs in the cli.

I'm just beginning to get to grips with C++ so I've completed the CodeCademy C++ pathway to get an understanding of the basic syntax and completed a load of CodeWars challenges to put these skills to the test. After this I wanted to take on a really simple cli based project so that I could learn a little bit more about the language in a more practical environment. It was also a great project to develop my understanding of classes and object oriented programming.
